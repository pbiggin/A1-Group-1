        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>Bowling is a popular recreational activity played by people of all ages. </p>
        <p>The term most commonly refers to ten-pin bowling, a competitive game in which players aim to knowck down
            a
            set of ten pins using a bowling ball. Its history can be traces all the way back to anceient Egypt,
            where
            participants rolled stones at different objects with the aim of knowcking them over. Nowadays, the most
            popular form of the sport involves a narrow lane, pins, and bowling ball of the player's preferred size.
