            <p>Valorant is a first-person shooter video game that was released in 2020, developed by Riot Games (League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics). It adheres to a format similar to that set by the Counter-Strike games. The game is generally played with two teams, each consisting of 5 players. The players choose characters, which all have different abilities which can affect the end result of the game in different ways. The players are then loaded onto a map within a rotating map pool, which consists of a few sites. Each team is assigned either an attacking or defending role. The primary objective of a round for the defending team is to plant the spike (a type of bomb) at a designated site on the map within a certain time frame and defend the spike until its detonation, or eliminate all members of the opposing attacking team. For the attacking team, their primary objective is to prevent the defending team from planting by stalling for time (eliminating the defending team or denying access to the site), or defusing the spike after itâ€™s been planted. This game typically ends after a team wins 13 rounds. It is made up of two halves, in between which the teams switch roles.</p>
