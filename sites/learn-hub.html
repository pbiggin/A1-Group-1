      Cricket is a team game, played by two competing groups of 11 players each
      with a Bat and a ball. The objective of Cricket is to ultimately gain a
      bigger score by the opposing team through "runs", with each team taking
      turns Batting and Fielding as one "inning". Games often include one or two
      innings each, however it is dependant by

        High levels of the game are <span class="spanbold">typically played on an oval </span> including a
        rectangular strip in the middle of the oval called the pitch. The
        wickets, two sets of three long sticks in the ground, are set at each
        end of the pitch. They also have horizontal small sticks laying on top
        of the wickets known as the bails.

      <h2>Batting</h2>
      <p>
        In an inning, teams will get the opportunity to play  <span class="spanbold"> two positions. </span> The
        'Batting' team's objective is to hit the ball thrown by the opposing
        'fielding' team, <span class="spanbold"> to defend the wicket,</span> and to then be able to 
         <span class="spanbold"> gain points via runs. </span> 
        Two batsman are up at one time, and the batsman facing the delivered ball tries to hit the ball,
        preventing the opposing team from knocking over the wicket.
      </p>
      <div class="imgCenter">
        <img src="../images/pitch-image.avif" alt="image of a Batter attempting to hit a pitch, with the wicket keeper catching the ball behind them" width="60%" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Depending on how the ball is hit, the batsmen will have  <span class="spanbold">  two options: </span> A
        defensive hit will allow the batting team defend the wicket, but limits
        their ability to score. An offensive hit allows for the opportunity for
        the pair of batsmen to run to their opposite ends of the pitch, gaining
        a run.  <span class="spanbold"> Another way the batting team can gain runs </span> (points) is to hit the
        ball to the boundary lines. If the ball lands on the ground and then
        touches the boundary, four runs are gained and if the ball lands on the
        ground outside the boundary, then six runs are gained.

        Question: How many players from the batting team are on the field at any
        time?

      <button class="hideaway">Click to reveal answer</button>
      <div class="hideContent">
        <p>
          Answer: Two! The batting team will always have two batters on the
          field at any time, leading to a total of 13 players on the field
          across both teams. The rest of the batting team when not in play will
          remain off field, and change over after innings & runs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Fielding</h2>
      <p>
        In the other half of the Inning, the teams will swap, with one team
        playing the the  <span class="spanbold"> 'Fielding' position.</span> The aim of the fielding team - is
        to use their 'Bowlers' to prevent / limit the opposing team from gaining
        runs. The opposing team can be prevented from scoring any points by the
        fielding team delivering the ball is to hit the wicket so the bails
        fall, causing the batsman to be dismsised.  <span class="spanbold"> The bowler can only deliver
        six balls at one wicket in a row, </span> which wil; complete an "over". After
        an over, another bowler will complete another over of six balls whilst
        the batting side defends its wicket.  <span class="spanbold">  For the remaining 9 'fielder'
        players, their role is to distribute around to catch and deliver the
        ball back to the pitch. </span>

        <p>
          Answer: To prevent the opposing team from scoring points. This can be
          achieved by either: Hitting the wicket and knocking the bails off with
          their pitch or through their team delivering the ball after being hit
          to knock the bails of.
