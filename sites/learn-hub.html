      Cricket is a team game, played by two competing groups of 11 players each
      with a Bat and a ball. The objective of Cricket is to ultimately gain a
      bigger score by the opposing team through "runs", with each team taking
      turns Batting and Fielding as one "inning". Games often include one or two
      innings each, however it is dependant by game factors, or formats.

        High levels of the game are typically played on an oval including a
        rectangular strip in the middle of the oval, the pitch, approximately 20
        metres by 3 metres wide. The wickets, two sets of three long sticks in
        the ground, are set at each end of the pitch. They also have horizontal
        small sticks laying on top of the wickets known as the bails.

        <h2>Batting</h2>
        <p>
          In an inning, teams will get the opportunity to play two positions.
          The 'Batting' team's objective is to hit the ball thrown by the
          opposing 'fielding' team, to defend the wicket. Two batsman are up at
          one time, and the batsman facing the delivered ball tries to hit the
          ball, preventing the opposing team from knocking over the wicket.
          Depending on how the ball is hit, the batsmen will have two options: A
          defensive hit will allow the batting team defend the wicket, but
          limits their ability to score. An offensive hit allows for the
          opportunity for the pair of batsmen to run to their opposite ends of
          the pitch, gaining a run. Another way the batting team can gain runs
          (points) is to hit the ball to the boundary lines. If the ball lands
          on the ground and then touches the boundary, four runs are gained and
          if the ball lands on the ground outside the boundary, then six runs
          are gained.

        <h2>Fielding</h2>
        <p>
          In the other half of the Inning, the teams will swap, with one team
          playing the the 'Fielding' position. The aim of the fielding team - is
          to use their 'Bowlers' to prevent / limit the opposing team from
          gaining runs. The opposing team can be prevented from scoring any
          points by the fielding team delivering the ball is to hit the wicket
          so the bails fall, causing the batsman to be dismsised. The bowler can
          only deliver six balls at one wicket in a row, which wil; complete an
          "over". After an over, another bowler will complete another over of
          six balls whilst the batting side defends its wicket. For the
          remaining 9 'fielder' players, their role is to distribute around to
          catch and deliver the ball back to the pitch.
