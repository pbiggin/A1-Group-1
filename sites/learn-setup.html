      <h2>Setting up the game</h2>
      <p>
        To run a game of cricket, there are three main areas of organisation
        needed: First, the equipment to play the game is required. Second, the
        field & pitch must be organised. Finally, the stratergy of gameplay
        should also be decided, within teams.
      </p>
      <h2>Equipment</h2>
      <p>
        Cricket requires a few pieces of specialised equipment to play in a safe
        and effective manner. To play a full game, you will need atleast 6
        stumps, 4 bails, 2 cricket bats and 1 ball. Cricket bats are a large,
        wooden bat that is flat on one face, and rounded on the other (To give
        the bat strength). PLayers hit the ball with the flat side of the bat,
        to create the best distance possible for the hit. Runs will not be
        counted if hit from the curved side of the bat. The stumps and Bails are
        wooden components that used to create the wicket. The cricket ball, is a
        ball sewn with a straight line creating two equal hemispheres. Gear is
        required for the wicket keeper to protect the player from impact when
        catching the pitched ball. See Content for more detail on Equipment used
        in games.

        Question: How is a cricket ball constructed differently from other
        sports balls?

      <button class="hideaway">Click to reveal answer</button>
      <div class="hideContent">
        <p>
          Answer: The ball has a solid, sewn line splitting it into two halves.
          Did you know? Cricket balls are often red with white stiching for
          visibility, however during games that go into the night, a white ball
          is used.

      <h2>The Field</h2>
      <p>
        The field is often a large, oval-shaped space with a rectangular strip
        in the center (the pitch). The field should be marked with a boundary
        line around the edge of the field. For casual games, The field can be a
        non oval-shape. The field has two postiion catergories: Offside &
        Legside The Offside - which is the side to the batsman's left and the
        opposing bowler's right. The Legside- (Onside) is the field on the
        batsman's right. The Distrubution of players for the fielding team is
        determined by these two sides, and the dominant hand of the batter to
        determine where best to postion players to intercept the ball when hit.

        <h2>The Pitch</h2>
        <p>
          To set up the pitch, a zone of 20.1m long by 3m wide should be created
          in the middle of the field. The pitch should be divided into areas
          called 'Creases'. There are Four types of creases: -
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The popping Crease (Otherwise known as the Batting Crease). This
            crease marks the boundary where the runner is safe from being run
            out. (taken out of play by the fielding team).
          </li>
          <li>
            The return creases (two in the pitch) run along the side from the
            popping prese to the end of the pitch
          </li>
          <li>
            The bowling crease runs parallel to the popping crease, inbetween
            the 2 return creases.
          </li>
          <li>Each end of the pitch is marked with the last crease.</li>

      <div class="hideContent">
        <p>
          Answer: 8! There are Four lines on each side of the pitch - Marking
          the Creases where the batters run, wicket is placed and where the ball
          is pitched from.

        <h2>The Wickets</h2>
        <p>
          The Wickets are two structures constructed from 3 sticks, called
          stumps. The stumps are driven into the ground, with 2 bails (pieces
          across the wickets) set in divots between each pair. Wickets should be
          around 72.4cm high, and 22.9cm wide (between all three stumps). The
          center of the wickets are placed at the center of the each bowling
          crease.
