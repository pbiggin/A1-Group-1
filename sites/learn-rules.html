        <p id="contrast">
          When playing or watching cricket, there are a few basic rules that teams
        should follow to ensure safe, fair and fun gameplay.

      <p>  <span class="spanbold"> the rules of cricket, in short: </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Teams should consist of  <span class="spanbold">  11 players</span></li>
        <li>The bowler must bowl <span class="spanbold">  6 deliveries </span> to complete an over</li>
        <li>Games must have <span class="spanbold">  two umpires </span></li>
        <li>
          Batsmen can be delivered  <span class="spanbold"> 'Outs'</span> which takes them out of the field
          untill their next turn to bat.
        </li>
        <li>The Fielding team must have  <span class="spanbold">  one wicket keeper. </span> </li>
        <li>
          Scoring is <span class="spanbold">  calculated through runs, </span> but can be impacted by other game
          elements.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <h2>Player setup</h2>
        <p>Each team is made up of  <span class="spanbold"> 11 players* </span></p>
        <div class="imgCenter">

        </div>
        <p>*Some professional teams, like the Men's Australian Cricket team (Pictured above) contain more than 11 players, but only 11 play in any game at any time.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Overs</h2>
      <p>
        In each game,  <span class="spanbold">  Overs are counted after 6 bowls. </span> At the over, the bowler
        must be replaced with a new bowler (No bowler can throw consecutive
        overs) Bowlers may rotate in again after  <span class="spanbold">  atleast 1 bowl from another
        bowler. </span> Batters may also change between overs, depending on which end
        of the pitch they are on when the over is called. Batters can change
        postion after each run.  <span class="spanbold"> Every time the bowler bowls the ball, (Even if
        the striker hits the ball or not), a tally is counted,  </span> which contributes
        to the over.

      <h2>Umpiring</h2>
      <p>
        standing at each end of the wicket,  <span class="spanbold">  two umpires are required to oversee
        each game. </span> Umpires count the number of balls in an over, and makes
        decisions about appeals, and checks if the bowler has bowled a legal
        delivery.

      <h2>Batsmen Outs</h2>
    <p>
      During the game, batsmen can  <span class="spanbold">  be declared out, </span> upon which they must leave
      the field and be replaced by a teammate. There are a range of ways a
      batsman can be declared out:  </p>

    <button class="hideaway">Click to reveal answer</button>
    <div class="hideContent">
      <p>
        Answer: 10 Outs can be accumulated before the inning is declared over.
        As there are only 11 players on a team, If a fielding team scores 10
        outs in an inning, the inning is over as there are no more batsmen on
        the batting team to fill the both batter postions in the pitch. You can
        calculate your own and other players averages here at our
        <a href="cricketcalc.html"> Calculator </a>.

      <h2>Wicket keepers</h2>
      <p>
        The fielding team must have   <span class="spanbold"> one designated wicket keeper. </span> The wicket
        keeper is the only player allowed to wear pads and gloves on the field,
        and stands behind the opporsite end to the bowler to catch the ball.
      </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Scores</h2>
        <p>
          After a specified amount of overs or Innings (Dependant on the game
          format) Scores are compared, and the team with  <span class="spanbold">  the largest score wins. </span>
          Beyond runs,   <span class="spanbold"> addtional elements </span>that contribute to the score &
          gameplay of cricket are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="spanbold"> Extras </span>- awarded to the batting team upon fielding errors or
            penalities oncured on the fielding side. Some common examples are:
            wides (balls bowled too far outside of the batting player's reach),
            no balls (Illegal deliveries).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="spanbold">  Boundaries (see batting) </span>. Boundasry scoring adds a unique factor for
            the game, allowing for scoring to change quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="spanbold"> Strike Rate  </span>- a statistic that measures the batsman's scoring speed,
            often used to gain insight on player's approach and skill. A high
            strike rate can mean the player is attempting to gain quick runs,
            whilst a lower strike rate may indicate the player is taking a more
            defenisve & accumulative approach.

        Question: Why do teams / broadcasters of cricket matches calculate their

        <p>
          Answer: To add more interest & allow analysis of gameplay! Cricket is
          a widely enjoyed game, but includes alot of tatics, skill and
          technique to play at a high level. Statistics provide insight on how
          well a player plays, their improvement and their typical batting and
          fielding styles (Defensive or Offensive). You can calculate your own
          and other players averages here at our
