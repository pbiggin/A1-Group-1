        <h2>Darts, Where do I start?</h2>
        <p>Darts, a competitive and casually enjoyed sport / game, is an indoor throwing game </br>
           where players through small projectiles (Darts) at a board to score points. Points are </br>
           collated by where specifically players hit – which are distributed individually across the </br>
           board, often within the goal to deduct a certain number of points within standard play (501).
        </p>
        <p>
           Starting with darts, the main information to know is the rules, strategy and scoring of the </br>
           game, then you can move onto playing different game modes & types, be it with friends </br>
           or within friendly competition!

          <h2>Rules of Gameplay</h2>
          <p>To play darts, some overall guidelines must be followed to ensure a fair, accurate and </br>
            safe game is conducted. This includes how players organise the game setup, </br>
            organisation of turn order and how each game should be operated.</p>

          <h3> Play rules: </h3>
          <ul class="rules">
            <Li> To decide playing order: each player starts the game by throwing a single dart </br>
              each, with the throw l anding closest to the bullseye going first.</Li>
            <li> Each turn, traditionally a player is tasked throw three darts, unless the game </br>
               is won in less.</li>
            <li>Points may only be calculated for darts that reach the board at the end of a turn, </br>
               any darts that bounce or fall cannot be thrown again.</li>
            <li> If a player scores more than their remaining points required to win, their throw </br>
               ends and is scored zero.  </br>
                (E.g.: A player has 16 remaining and accidentally hit a 20 with their first dart, their </br>
                turn is ended, and they receive no points). </li>
            <li> Players must throw darts from a specific distance from the board (See setup </br>
               below)</li>
            <li> Darts games traditionally consist of 'Legs' (Rounds), where each game is resolved </br>
            after a set amount of 'legs' are won. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3> Setup: </h3>
          <p>
            Dartboards should be set up within a safe and comfortable location for players, </br>
            optimally within an environment without any potential hazards – Spaces that are well lit, </br>
            well mounted and have protection on the floors, walls and other surfaces allow for </br>
            gameplay puncture-free. </p>

          <p> For official setup rules, the main requirements are as follows: </p>
          <ul class="ruless">
            <li> The centre of the board (the Bullseye) should be 173cm high from the ground, or </br>
               137cm for players in wheelchairs.</li>
            <li> Players must throw from a clearly marked throwline, of a set distance of 237cm </br>
               horizontally from the board, for both standing and seated players. </br>
               (Extra) throwing space is recommended to be at least 152cm W x 3.35m </br>
               in size, to allow for safe distances between players, the board to protect </br>
               players and any items within the game-space.
              </li>
          </ul>

        <section class="dsect">
          <h2>How Scoring works</h2>
          <p>Dartboards are divided into distinct sections – The Bulls (Inner and Outer), Individual </br>
             numbers, and doubling or treble sections.</p>

          <h3> The Bulls </h3>
          <p> Includes both the main and outer Bullseyes – the circle points at the centre of the </br>
             board. Hitting this area scores 50 points for the centre Bullseye and 25 for the outer bull </br>
             ring. </p>

          <h3> Individual numbers </h3>
          <p> This includes all the wide spaces on the dartboard that are not within the narrow rings or </br>
             the bullseye. Hitting one of these sections will award you the number of points as </br>
             written in the corresponding section at the end of the board. These are 'Single-Scoring', </br>
             as they only award 1 multiple of the points allocated.</p>

          <h3> Double / Treble rings </h3>
          <p> These areas are the two rings seen in the middle and edge of the board. (Usually green & </br>
             red on the dart board). The outer ring – the Double – when hit grant the player a </br>
             multiplier of 2 on the points on the outer edge of the board. (Alike individuals, the base </br>
             point number is calculated from the outer edge numbers)
          <p>The inner ring – The Treble – Score the player a multiplier of 3 to the corresponding </br>
             number on the outer edge board.</p>
          <p> Both Treble & Double rings only apply to the throw and dart that hits it. (Multipliers do </br>
             not count across multiple throws)</p>

          <h3> Bounced / Fallen darts </h3>
          <p> Failing to hit the board or darts that do not remain on the board at the end of the round </br>
            do not score any points. Whoops!</p>

               failed to become a killer will have an opportunity to become one each turn, until their lives 
               are lost, or they achieve killer status.
