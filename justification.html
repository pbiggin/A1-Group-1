      <h1>Project Justification</h1>
      <h3>Homepage (Index.html)</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage is structured to allow for easy navigation across the 5
        main pages + The justification page. This page was designed to emphasise
        the 5 game pages by using anchor icons (Using <'a'> to connect each html
        file and "img" embedded within the anchor), and css elements (a:hover +
        simple size editing) to be the focal point of the page. Each button has
        its own div (.gamelink), to allow for structuring adequate spacing
        inside the main buttons div (.gamebox). The justification link is placed
        as an hyperlink anchor in a footer to be viewed last. Names are placed
        below each icon for context (within the .gamelink div).
      </p>

      <h2>cross-page choices:</h2>
      <h3>Navigation Bar (Fixed position)</h3>
      <p>
        We chose to include a consistently structured navigation bar across all
        5 game pages to allow the user to easily switch between the game,
        homepage & justification pages. In CSS, properties of colour, font size,
        float, text-align and padding were used to format the navigation bar,
        using the class selector. The ‘active’ selector was also used to make
        the specified game button (e.g: 'Game 2') visually different from other
        non-active buttons. The :hover selector was also used to make the
        navigation bar more appealing through changing colours.
      </p>

        <h2>Individual page choices:</h2>
        <h3>Darts page (phoebe.html) Phoebe</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I used anchors to specific sections across the page to allow the
            user to more conveniently move between content. The buttons under
            the ‘darts’ title are connected as an unordered list to allow for
            a:hover effects.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used an Iframe at the end of the webpage to allow the user to view
            other related darts content (youtube videos) easily within the site.
          </li>
          <li>
            I organised the content of the page through "articles", and then
            into "sections" to allow a row flex direction of content for the
            viewer, especially for the rule unordered lists & dart board
            diagrams.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used a table to showcase game modes through their components to be
            more easily understood by the viewer. Included a “top” button at the
            footer to allow users back to the jump segments conveniently.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cricket Page (cricket.html) Jasleen</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the <'header'> element, using a unique class attribute, I’ve
            added contents of my header which in this case only included the
            name of the page, ‘cricket’. I have also directly underneath whilst
            using padding to create space, added a general image of cricket
            being played to span across the page as a way to separate ‘cricket’
            from the rest of the page as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <'h2'> tag was used to start the new sections of content for
            ‘Overview of the Game’ and ‘Rules’, with a distinct font and colour,
            pushed to the left.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a <'div'> tag with a class attribute of ‘flex-container’, in
            CSS the ‘display’ property had a value of ‘flex,’ to have the
            relevant content and image sit horizontally in order to make each
            section look more in union.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using an <'img'> tag, pictures were added including alternate
            (‘alt’) information describing the image in case the image cannot be
            displayed.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make the ‘Methods of Dismissal’ content more distinctive from the
            previous sections, I have used a green background colour and also
            aligned the heading to be in the centre rather than on the left
            under a new <'div'> tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using another <'div'> tag within, I have also embedded a youtube
            video using <'iframe'> tag. In CSS, that also includes adding a
            black border - a new visual element for the page for engagement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a <'div'> tag with a class attribute of ‘row’, in CSS the
            ‘display’ property has a value of ‘flex.’ This allowed for three
            images to sit horizontally next to each other - adding alt text and
            individual padding.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to show the characteristics of the three formats of
            cricket, I have used the <'table'> tag with 6 sets of
            <tr>
              tags including the first defining the three format names using the
              <'th'> tag. Remaining <'tr'> tag contains one <'th'> tag
              specifying the type of characteristic, followed by three <'td'>
              tags containing the content for each format for that row. In CSS,
              I have changed the font so the headings are more bold and clear to
              the user they are headings in comparison to the <'p'> content. I
              have added a green border around the table to have the table look
              more visually separate.
            </tr>
          </li>

          <li>
            I have also added another <'div'> tag that contains a hyperlink to
            the Australian National Team so the user can get information on the
            current team players. I have used the :hover selector and once the
            button is clicked, the background colour of the button is also
            changed too using the :active and :visited selectors in CSS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the <'footer'> tag that is outside of the <'body'> tag, I have
            included a footer at the bottom of the page. In CSS I have made the
            background black to be distinctive as well using padding and margin.
          </li>
